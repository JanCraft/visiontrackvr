# VisionTrackVR
Tracking your full body anywhere, with just a webcam.

## How it works?
VisionTrackVR uses a MediaPipe machine-learning model to track the position of your joints and transforms them into usable SteamVR Trackers.

## Quality
While the quality may not be good, it still counts as full body tracking, and it's practically free.

The quality depends on the power of your computer and your webcam.
